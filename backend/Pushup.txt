Form Standard (Good Rep):

Begin in a high plank position: hands slightly wider than shoulders, feet hip-width apart, body in a straight line from head to heels. 


Keep core engaged, glutes tight, shoulders recruited—avoid sagging hips or raised butt. 


Hands positioned directly under or just outside shoulders; wrists, elbows and shoulders aligned. 


Elbows should bend to approx 45° angle relative to torso (for many individuals) as you lower the body. 


Lower body until chest is just above floor (or until elbows approx 90°) while maintaining body line, then push back up through palms to full extension. 


Common Errors and What to Look For:

Hips sagging toward the floor or raised too high (pike position) — breaks straight line. 


Elbows flaring out wide (>60°) which can stress shoulders. 


Hands too far forward or too wide from shoulders. 


Incomplete range of motion (too shallow) not lowering chest near floor. 

Poor core/bracing resulting in arching back or letting belly drop. 


Neck craning up or head dropping downward.



Safety Flags:

If wrists or shoulders hurt when hands placed under, modify by elevating hands or using push-up handles.

If hips sag or back arches, stop and practise plank hold to build core.

If depth is too shallow because of fatigue or form breakdown, end set; better fewer good reps than many poor ones.

Avoid bouncing off floor or speed pushing; maintain control.

If neck is extended or drops repeatedly, adjust vantage point or use mirror.

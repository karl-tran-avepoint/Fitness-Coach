Form Standard (Good Rep):

Feet slightly wider than hip-width, toes pointed slightly outward. 


Sit the hips back and down as if lowering into a chair; knees track in line with toes. 

Lower until thighs are at least parallel to the ground (if mobility allows) while keeping weight distributed through heels and mid-foot. 


Maintain a neutral spine: chest up, back straight (not rounded or overly arched). Engage core. 


Rise by pushing through heels and mid-foot, hips and knees extending together. Reset posture before next rep. 


Common Errors and What to Look For:

Knees collapsing inward (valgus) or drifting off over toes. 


Not sitting back (hips too forward) or weight shifting onto toes. 


Heels lifting off the ground. 

Rounding or arching the lower back (lose neutral spine). 

Chest dropping forward or head tilting down/up. 


Depth too shallow (thighs above parallel) when mobility allows deeper.

Safety Flags:

If you cannot maintain flat feet or heels stay elevated → reduce depth or work on ankle mobility.

If lower back loses neutral alignment (rounds or arches) → stop, reduce range, strengthen core/back.

If knee alignment is poor (inward collapse) → consider glute and hip abductors strengthening and perform body-weight reps only.

If depth becomes too shallow due to pain or fatigue → terminate set.

Always breathe: inhale descending, exhale ascending.
